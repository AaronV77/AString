# AString

A string implementation in C.

This repository consists of a string library implement in C. The library that I have 
created is not perfect but gets the job done for me. I will slowly update / upgrade
the library to be suitable for my needs and others. I hope this library is a great
starting point for your library or it is just useful for you. 

## Getting Started

Just follow the upcoming sections they should make startup very clear.

## Warnings

This library is not responsible for any mistakes that it may contain within the source code. 

## Prerequisites

The library was built just just C, so make sure that you have the gcc compiler installed.

## Installing

I would recommend setting up this repository as a submodule and then just creating a link to
the archive file that gets created when the make file is ran. If that is too much then just
merge the files into your source directory. 

## Testing

There are tests for this library and are located in the test directory. You will have to build the library, copy the tester file to the src directory, and then run the output file. The commit 0dc4824 has been memory checked and is completely Valgrind compliant with no issues. 
 
 ## Contributing

If you like to add to this library just submit a PR.
