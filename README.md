# AString

A string implementation in C.

This repository consists of a string library implement in C. The library that I have 
created is not perfect but gets the job done for me. I will slowly update / upgrade
the library to be suitable for my needs and others. I hope this library is a great
starting point for your library or it is just useful for you. 

## Getting Started

Just follow the upcoming sections they should make startup very clear.

## Warnings

This library is not responsible for any mistakes that it may contain within the source code. 

## Prerequisites

The library was built just just C, so make sure that you have the gcc compiler installed.

## Installing

I would recommend setting up this repository as a submodule and then just creating a link to
the archive file that gets created when the make file is ran. If that is too much then just
merge the files into your source directory. 

## Testing

There are no tests yet for this library but they are on my radar to do. 

## Contributing

If you like to add to this library just submit a PR.
